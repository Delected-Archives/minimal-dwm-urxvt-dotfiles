here are some of my config files...

will post zathura one once i find it (it's not in my ~/.config/zathura for some reason, it was literally there yesterday

requires:
- pywal and some background image program that pywal supports (i use hsetroot)
- picom (optional, but dwm alpha patch, transparent zathura, and window fade in/out won't work without it. urxvt transparency will still work because it uses "fake" transparency.)
